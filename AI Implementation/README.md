This section contains a detailed summary of the algorithms studied in this course, including how they work, real-life applications, and complexities.

## üîç Uninformed Search Algorithms

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
**How it works:** Explores all nodes level by level using a queue (FIFO).  
**Applications:** Shortest path in unweighted graphs, social network analysis.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^d)  
- Space: O(b^d)  

---

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
**How it works:** Explores as deep as possible before backtracking; uses a stack or recursion.  
**Applications:** Puzzle solving, pathfinding in mazes.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^m)  
- Space: O(b\*m)  

---

### 3. Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
**How it works:** Combines DFS and BFS by increasing depth limit step-by-step.  
**Applications:** Game trees, memory-efficient pathfinding.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^d)  
- Space: O(b\*d)  

---

### 4. Bidirectional Search
**How it works:** Runs two simultaneous BFS searches‚Äîfrom the start and from the goal‚Äîand meets in the middle.  
**Applications:** GPS navigation, robot motion planning.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^(d/2))  
- Space: O(b^(d/2))  

---

### 5. Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
**How it works:** DFS with a fixed maximum depth.  
**Applications:** Large search trees with known depth limits.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^l)  
- Space: O(b\*l)

## üß† Informed Search Algorithms

### 6. Heuristic Search
**How it works:** Uses a heuristic function to estimate cost from current node to goal.  
**Applications:** Pathfinding in games, robotics, planning.  
**Complexity:** Depends on heuristic quality.

---

### 7. Best-First Search
**How it works:** Expands the node with the lowest heuristic value.  
**Applications:** Pathfinding, AI planning.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^m)  
- Space: O(b^m)  

---

### 8. A\* (A-Star) Search
**How it works:** Uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n) (actual cost + heuristic) to find the optimal path.  
**Applications:** Google Maps, game AI, robotics.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^d)  
- Space: O(b^d)  

---

### 9. AO\* Algorithm
**How it works:** Works on AND-OR graphs to find optimal solutions by expanding paths that are most promising.  
**Applications:** Problem solving in decision trees with subgoals, diagnostics.  
**Complexity:** Varies with graph and heuristic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimization Algorithms

### 10. Hill Climbing
**How it works:** Starts with a random solution and makes small changes to improve it.  
**Applications:** Feature selection, scheduling, configuration problems.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(n) to O(n^2)  
- Space: O(1)  

---

### 11. Beam Search
**How it works:** Keeps only top k best nodes at each level instead of all; limits memory.  
**Applications:** Speech recognition, machine translation.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(k \* b \* d)  
- Space: O(k \* d)

## üéÆ Game Playing Algorithms

### 12. Minimax Algorithm
**How it works:** Assumes both players play optimally and chooses moves to maximize the minimum gain.  
**Applications:** Chess, tic-tac-toe, checkers, other 2-player games.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^m)  
- Space: O(m)  

---

### 13. Alpha-Beta Pruning
**How it works:** Improves Minimax by cutting off branches that won‚Äôt affect the result.  
**Applications:** Chess engines, game AI.  
**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(b^(m/2))  
- Space: O(m)
